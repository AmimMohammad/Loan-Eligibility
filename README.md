This code snippet is part of a loan eligibility calculator. It calculates monthly loan repayments using simple interest, checks if a user is eligible for a loan based on their income and existing loans, and adjusts interest rates based on loan tenure and credit score. The user inputs their financial details, and the program evaluates their loan eligibility, recommends a maximum loan amount considering their financial health, and explores different loan scenarios. This project demonstrates practical financial concepts through Python programming, making it a useful tool for understanding personal finance management.
